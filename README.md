Funny Code generated by Bing Chat.
 
I asked Bing Chat to make me one of those cheesy 90's school picture day background with lasers. You know which one I'm talking about.

I didn't ask it in Image Creator just regular ol' Bing Chat.

Bing chat said it couldn't make me an image but it could generate me some code that would generate the image.

"This ought to be fun!" I said.

I looked over the python code and I could see where it was going.... Here is the result after running it.

Not exactly what I was imaging, but I'll give it a solid C- for at least giving me a solution and a good laugh.
